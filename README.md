Sample testcases for Jenkins pipelines

## Notes

### February 17, 2017

When creating a stage, the use of parenthesis around the stage name, and curly braces around its body, as shown below,
is the correct, current way. Doing so without is deprecated, and you'll see this message in your console log:

Using the ‘stage’ step without a block argument is deprecated

The deprecated way of writing this stage would look like this:

    stage "myFancyStageName"
    echo "I just did something awesome."
    node {
        sh 'whoami'
    }

Same stage, written the new way:

    stage ('myFancyStageName') {
        echo "I just did something awesome."
        node {
            sh 'whoami'
        }
    }
